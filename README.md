## Introducing VeloResearch cycling Elo ratings
This is my implementation of the [Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system), which was initially developed for rating chess players. I will be posting periodic updates to pro cycling Elo ratings for GC, time trialing, and sprinting to my [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/veloresearch). This project was inspired by [FiveThirtyEight's use of Elo Ratings](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-we-calculate-nba-elo-ratings/) in sports such as the NFL and cycling content creators such as the Lanterne Rouge Cycling Podcast (run by Patrick Broe and Benji Naesen) but is by no means the first application of Elo Ratings to cycling. There are existing projects such as that of [Motirolo Analyses](https://mortirolo.netlify.app/) which track cycling Elo ratings for multiple disciplines, as well as Twitter accounts such as [El Tio del Dato](https://twitter.com/eltiodeldato?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor). Others, such as [Zoer Cycling Stats](https://twitter.com/ZoerCyclingStat) deal mostly with using machine learning predicting the outcomes of cycling races.

As they were initially developed for chess, the basic Elo algorithms concerns itself with 2-player games. FiveThirtyEight's version also generally follows this paradigm. To apply this system to a multiplayer game such as cycling, I treat each race as a series of head-to-head results which occur simultaneously. Most multiplayer Elo systems I have seen also do something similar. I recently came across Danny Cunningham's [generalized Elo rating system, developed for poker](https://towardsdatascience.com/developing-a-generalized-elo-rating-system-for-multiplayer-games-b9b495e87802#:~:text=In%20standard%20two%2Dplayer%20Elo,calculations%20can%20continue%20as%20normal.), which proposes an interesting approach to applying Elo to multiplayer games, and I may try his system on cycling to see how it compares to what I have come up with.

## What do the VeloResearch Elo ratings bring to the table?
Aside from a different implementation and different parameters, there are a couple of new things my Elo ratings bring to the table. My system supports ratings for GC, time trialing, and sprinting for both men's and women's cycling. Further, my system utilizes data from the last twelve years of pro cycling results, and plan to go back further. When there is a lull in contemporary cycling results, I may go back in time and release Elo ratings at certain points in years past.

Other similar projects also delve into prediction and probability using Elo ratings and other techniques. I'm not there yet, but I'm extremely interested in the possibilities there. Cycling results, particularly results for one-off races or stages, can be extremely difficult to predict. I want to find out exactly how well future cycling results can be modeled.

## Some examples
The [VeloResearch Twitter account](https://twitter.com/veloresearch) will be updated more often with up-to-date ratings for different disciplines, but here are a couple of examples of the VeloResearch Elo ratings.

First, we have the general GC picture across all of men's pro cycling as of June 10, 2022: ![](research/figures/gc-men-20220610.png).
